    "**Date:** October 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook documents the development and validation process for the core AI models of the ReviewLens platform. The objective is to test a suite of four distinct NLP models on a sample of the dataset to validate their effectiveness and to prototype the foundational Python code for the production AWS Lambda functions. This notebook serves as a professional artifact detailing the data science workflow, from data preparation to model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AI Models Tested:\n",
    "1.  **Sentiment Analysis:** For overall positive/negative classification.\n",
    "2.  **Zero-Shot Classification:** For dynamic topic tagging.\n",
    "3.  **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA):** For fine-grained sentiment on specific features.\n",
    "4.  **Topic Modeling:** For discovering latent themes in the text corpus."

I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12, but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee, so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.]</td>\n",

This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online. it's so flattering, it fits like a dream, and i love the fabric. i love that the skirt is a true a-line, not poofy, so it's sleek, slimming and flattering. the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy, while still being classy. oh, and the length, perfection! not too long, not too short. i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to. i am a curvy size 4 and it fits perfectly true to size. i couldn't be hap, Love it but runs small I love the print and design, the photo does not do it justice. i fell in love with it in the store but could not find my size. i ordered my size online but it was still small and short. it came up to my waist, and was tight in the shoulders and waist. i really wish it wasn't so small. i love love this top, the colors are vibrant and shiny, totally my style. i highly recommend it if it fits., Great dress! I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12, but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee, so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.]  \n",
       "1  [Love this top This top is so much prettier on. you can dress it up or down. it does run a tad large. i'm 5'7\" and 145 lbs. i am usually in between a small and medium but usually a medium. i went for the small on this and i loved the fit of it. still pretty flowy and the medium would have been just too big. it is a tunic so it runs kind of long. a tiny bit too long for me but i will still wear it a lot., Really thick, quality top. very swingy bottom I bought the red and white. both tank tops were a nice, thick material- definitely high quality. i was hoping there would just be a little bit of swing at the bottom, just enough to be loose and flattering. but there is a ton of extra fabric at the end, which with a larger bust wound up edging into looking a little maternity. but i think it'd be great on you if you tend to do well with very drapey or swingy tops. it runs a touch big- im normally between a small and an xs, and the xs was not even, Adorable top I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder and 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back and a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top and it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute, casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it.]  \n",

I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those, but after trying both pairs on, i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro, but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8, which is what i seem to we, Great pants! These pants are beautiful. great fit and great fabric. really comfortable and elegant. i am tall 5'8\" and have a long torso so it's nice to find pants that are high waisted., I love these jeans! These jeans are so comfortable. they are well-made. they are the perfect pair of jeans. the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing. i am going to order these again in the next smaller size.]  \n",

    "\n",
    "The final, enriched table is a powerful business tool. Its value is unlocked by asking specific questions and combining the AI-generated columns to get answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a practical guide on how a business stakeholder would use this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Question 1: \"How are we doing?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** Use the `sentiment_prediction` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "By aggregating this column, a manager can get an instant, high-level KPI of overall customer happiness. This dashboard metric can be tracked weekly to spot immediate changes in brand perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Insight:**\n",
    "* \"This week, our Positive Sentiment Score dropped by 8%.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Business Question 2: \"Our sentiment dropped... *Why*?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** Combine `sentiment_prediction` and `zero_shot_topic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first level of diagnosis. A manager can filter for all reviews where `sentiment_prediction == 'NEGATIVE'` and then create a bar chart of the `zero_shot_topic` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Insight:**\n",
    "* \"Our sentiment dropped because of a 60% spike in complaints. By filtering for those complaints, we see that **72% of them are about 'shipping'**.\"\n",
    "* **Action:** The business now knows exactly where the problem is. They don't need to waste time investigating 'price' or 'quality'; they have a clear priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Business Question 3: \"Okay, shipping is the problem. But *what about* shipping?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** Combine `zero_shot_topic` and `aspects`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most powerful, granular insight. The manager can now filter for all reviews where `zero_shot_topic == 'shipping'` and analyze the `aspects` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Insight:**\n",
    "* By creating a word cloud from the `aspects` in this segment, they see that the most common phrases are **`delivery time (NEGATIVE)`** and **`box (NEGATIVE)`**.\n",
    "* **Action:** The business has its final answer. The problem isn't the cost of shipping; it's that the courier is slow and the packaging is getting damaged. They can now take surgical action, like renegotiating with their courier or improving their packaging materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Business Question 4: \"What problems are we not even aware of?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** Use the `bertopic_id` from the full, corpus-level analysis (as seen in section 4.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is performed by the `stitcher-lambda` on the entire dataset. It automatically clusters reviews by \"hidden themes\" that we didn't define in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Insight:**\n",
    "* By examining the `topic_model.get_topic_info()` output, the manager spots a new cluster (e.g., `[jeans, fit, pants, comfortable]`).\n",
    "* **Action:** The manager realizes that a huge number of customers (Count: 219) are discussing jeans not just in terms of price or quality (our predefined topics), but specifically in terms of fit and comfort. This hidden theme was previously invisible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Final Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has validated the logic for each of these four analytical layers. The deployed AWS pipeline is built to perform this exact multi-layer analysis at scale, transforming raw text feedback from a \"cost center\" (something to be stored) into a **strategic asset** (something to be queried)."
